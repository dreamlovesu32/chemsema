# ChemCore HarmonyOS PC

This is the first-stage HarmonyOS PC shell for ChemCore. It packages the existing web viewer and Rust/WASM engine into an ArkWeb-based HarmonyOS app, scoped to the `2in1` device type for desktop-class HarmonyOS devices.

## Commands

From the repository root:

```powershell
npm run harmony:sync-viewer
npm run harmony:build
```

`harmony:sync-viewer` copies `viewer/` into `entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/chemcore/`. The copied files are generated app assets and are intentionally ignored by Git.

`build-profile.json5` is local-only because DevEco Studio writes debug signing certificate paths and passwords into it. If the file is missing, the command-line wrapper copies `build-profile.example.json5` before running hvigor. Use DevEco Studio automatic signing to regenerate a signed local profile when installing to a device or emulator.

## Scope

- PC/2in1 only.
- No tablet-specific interaction work in this stage.
- No Office/OLE integration in this stage.
- Web UI plus WASM core, loaded locally through ArkWeb rawfile resources.

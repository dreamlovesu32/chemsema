# ChemCore

ChemCore is an open-source chemistry structure editor built from scratch for everyday research drawing, publication layout, and Office copy/paste workflows at ChemDraw-level fidelity. Maintainer: Jiajun ZHANG / 张家骏, [zhangjiajun21@sioc.ac.cn](mailto:zhangjiajun21@sioc.ac.cn). Feedback, issues, real CDXML files, and contributions are very welcome. The long-term goal is to make ChemCore a free research infrastructure platform that can later grow into automation, batch processing, AI-assisted research interfaces, and more carefully designed scientific software.

The core architecture is a shared Rust engine with a lightweight Web interface. Rust owns the document model, editing commands, hit testing, chemical label rules, implicit hydrogen logic, CDXML/CDX import/export, render primitive generation, and vector output needed by Office/OLE. The front end mainly collects events, manages UI state, and presents the result. Rust is used because this type of editor depends on long-lived geometry code, format parsers, and interaction state machines where memory safety, testability, performance, and typed boundaries matter. The same engine can compile to WASM for the browser and run as native code for the desktop shell and Windows Office integration; the desktop app uses Tauri/WebView2, so the UI can remain Web-based while behavior stays centralized in the cross-platform core.

## Published Figure Comparison

The comparison below uses CDXML source files from a published paper by the
maintainer:

Jiajun ZHANG, Pinhong Chen,* Guosheng Liu*, Copper-Catalyzed Site- and
Enantioselective C–H Cyanation of Trisubstituted Allenes,
[Chin. J. Chem. 2026, 44, 1729–1734](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cjoc.70531).

These are real publication figures rather than simplified demo fixtures. They
exercise molecule rendering, text layout, reaction arrows, brackets, colors,
radical/single-electron dots, graphical objects, and Office-oriented vector
output. The left column is exported by ChemDraw; the right column is exported by
ChemCore after importing the same CDXML files.

The generated SVG and EMF files for both ChemDraw and ChemCore are kept in
[docs/assets/readme/comparison](./docs/assets/readme/comparison/).

The original CDXML files are tracked at the repository root:
[f1.cdxml](./f1.cdxml) and [f2.cdxml](./f2.cdxml).

## Current Status

Current version: `1.0.0-beta`.

The Windows installer is coming soon and is still under testing. For now, the
browser and desktop builds can be run from source, and release binaries can be
built locally with the commands below.

## Product Highlights

- **Built for real research drawing workflows**: ChemCore is designed around drawing structures, arranging reaction schemes, copying into Word or PowerPoint, and returning later for editing.
- **ChemDraw-compatible files and layout habits**: CDXML/CDX import and export are first-class paths, with source structure, text, arrows, brackets, symbols, colors, and object positions preserved as much as possible.
- **One shared core for browser, desktop, and Office integration**: Editing rules, hit testing, chemical labels, render primitives, and import/export logic live in the Rust engine to avoid behavior drift between surfaces.
- **Low-latency editing**: Hover, focus, selection, drag preview, rotation, and zoom use local WASM/Rust hot paths instead of turning every pointer move into a cross-process request.
- **Modern desktop behavior**: The Tauri/WebView2 desktop shell supports file open/save, drag-to-open, recent files, tabs, unsaved-change prompts, shortcuts, and Windows file association.
- **Office paste and embedding are treated seriously**: Copy operations consider native ChemCore data, CDXML, SVG, EMF, RTF/OOXML, and OLE payloads so Office display and later editing remain reliable.

## Implemented Capabilities

- **CDXML/CDX import and export**: The Rust engine parses and writes ChemDraw-oriented formats, maps them into the ChemCore document model, and keeps enough drawing information for re-rendering and round trips.
- **Unified document and rendering model**: The document model, runtime scene, hit testing, selection state, and render primitives are defined in the engine while the front end focuses on events and display.
- **Complex bond geometry**: Single, double, triple, bold, dashed, solid wedge, hashed wedge, label clipping, bond joins, crossing gaps, and ChemDraw-style template parameters are implemented.
- **Arrows and graphical objects**: Reaction arrows, equilibrium arrows, hollow arrows, curved arrows, brackets, lines, shapes, and symbols are supported and continue to be aligned with ChemDraw interaction details.
- **Selection, drag, rotation, and arrangement**: Object-level and partial molecule selection, multi-select drag preview, rotation, flip, alignment, distribution, color application, and undoable command history are available.
- **Text and label editing**: Free text, endpoint element replacement, label editing, text selection, style synchronization, and the behavioral distinction between chemical labels and free text are handled.
- **Implicit hydrogen and element rules**: Main-group auto-hydrogen logic, valence counting, charge effects, and period-specific rules are centralized in the engine.
- **Abbreviation and group recognition**: Common abbreviations such as Me, Et, Ph, CN, NO2, Boc, Ts, TMS, TBDMS, and TBDPS are recognized and treated as groups during flipping, formula, and mass calculations.
- **Formula and mass statistics**: Selected structures can report formula weight, exact mass, and expanded abbreviation composition.
- **Desktop and Office foundations**: Browser, desktop, and Office/OLE boundaries are established, including Windows clipboard, EMF preview, and Word OOXML/OLE payload paths.

## Design Details

ChemCore focuses on the small details that decide whether a chemistry editor is
pleasant enough for real daily use. These rules live in the shared Rust engine
where possible, so the browser, desktop shell, SVG/EMF output, and Office paths
consume the same geometry.

### Text Clipping

ChemCore does not treat an atom label as one coarse rectangle. Endpoint labels
are split into styled runs and line runs, then the engine builds per-glyph clip
polygons from font size, baseline, subscript/superscript shifts, and character
advance data. When a bond is rendered, its endpoint ray intersects the glyph
polygon edges, picks the farthest exit point from the atom, and advances by the
bond's `label_clip_margin`. The default template uses `1.2pt`; ACS Document
1996 uses `0.8pt`.

Common uppercase letters and symbols use tuned height-centered glyph polygons
generated from Arial, including cases such as `N`, `I`, and `+`. Unknown
uppercase letters fall back to conservative uppercase profiles, and full-width
or CJK characters use square profiles. If a document has no glyph polygons, the
engine falls back to the label bounding box.

### Label Grouping

Chemical labels are grouped by uppercase-led fragments and known abbreviations,
not reversed character by character. For example, `OTMS` is grouped as `O` +
`TMS`, so a right-side label becomes `TMSO`, not `SMTO`. Anchors are assigned to
the chemically meaningful terminal letter rather than a trailing digit,
implicit hydrogen, or an internal abbreviation character.

### Bond Joins

Shared endpoints are computed as real polygons instead of relying on SVG stroke
caps. Each bond endpoint is converted into an axis, normal, left/right contour
lines, and half width. For two-bond joins, the engine intersects inner-inner and
outer-outer contours and stores endpoint profiles for each bond. For three or
more incident bonds, contours are sorted by polar angle and only adjacent pairs
are intersected, producing a ring of profiles around the node. Sharp angles are
limited by a miter cap.

### Crossing Gaps

Non-endpoint crossings use a separate knockout pass. Within a molecule
fragment, bonds are rendered in order and later bonds are treated as the upper
layer. Before drawing an upper bond, the engine checks it against already drawn
lower bonds, skips shared endpoints and near-parallel cases, and inserts a
white knockout polygon at true interior intersections. The gap length is
compensated by the crossing angle's sine, and the width uses the upper bond's
visual width plus its template `marginWidth`.

### Infinite Canvas

The editor uses a runtime `viewBox` rather than a fixed page-sized viewport.
The SVG `viewBox` is expressed in document-world coordinates, while CSS size is
computed from `pt -> css px -> zoom`; the scroll container is just a window into
that world. Empty documents start with a centered buffer around the visible
area. After each render, document bounds are compared with the current viewBox;
if content approaches an edge, the viewBox expands in that direction and
left/top expansions compensate scroll delta so the scene does not jump.

### Stable Interaction

Selection boxes, hover state, drag previews, rotation handles, curved-arrow
handles, text boxes, and graphical objects are kept stable in dense CDXML
documents. Selected content suppresses internal hover, drag previews follow
locally before committing to the engine, and each desktop tab preserves its
document, zoom, and runtime view state.

Architecturally, ChemCore keeps the rules that affect consistency inside the
engine wherever possible: hit testing, selection ranges, hover behavior,
drawing geometry, text clipping, bond joins, implicit hydrogen, abbreviation
recognition, CDXML parsing, and export rendering are shared by the browser,
desktop, and Office paths instead of being patched separately in the front end.

Complex CDXML compatibility, Office copy/paste, OLE embedding, and ChemDraw
format fidelity are still being actively refined. Reports with concrete files,
screenshots, or real Office workflows are especially useful.

## Welcome

If you use ChemDraw heavily, care about free research infrastructure, or are
interested in AI-assisted scientific software development, you are very welcome
to try ChemCore, open issues, join discussions, or contribute code.

The most useful feedback usually comes in two forms: concrete files with
screenshots that help align ChemDraw display and interaction, and real writing
workflows that expose copy/paste, Office editing, layout, or export problems.
ChemCore is not meant to be a demo that merely looks like an editor; the goal is
to become a tool that can enter daily research work.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable with the MSVC toolchain on Windows
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3 for local static serving and some optional analysis scripts
- `wasm-pack` is installed automatically by `npm run build:engine-wasm` when needed
- Windows is required for the desktop shell and Office/OLE integration paths

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cargo test
npm run build:engine-wasm
```

Run the browser editor from the repository root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory .
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/viewer/
```

Run the Windows desktop shell:

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

Build release binaries:

```bash
npm run desktop:build-fast
cargo build -p chemcore-office --release
```

Register the Office/OLE integration for the current user:

```bash
npm run office:register-dev
```

Unregister it:

```bash
npm run office:unregister-dev
```

## Verification

The main verification command is:

```bash
npm run verify
```

It runs Rust tests, rebuilds the browser engine WASM, checks viewer JavaScript
syntax, and verifies that generated `viewer/engine` files are synchronized.

Useful focused commands:

```bash
npm test
cargo test -p chemcore-engine
cargo test -p chemcore-office
npm run build:engine-wasm
node --check viewer/app.js
```

Some scripts compare output against locally installed desktop applications or
Office. Those flows are optional and may require Windows-specific software,
local documents, or `CHEMCORE_PYTHON` to point at a Python environment with the
needed analysis packages.

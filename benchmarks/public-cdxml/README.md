# Public CDXML/CDX Round-Trip Corpus

This benchmark uses public, license-clear ChemDraw CDXML/CDX files instead of
confidential research documents. Source files are downloaded into ignored
`tmp/` storage and are not vendored into the ChemSema repository.

The pinned manifest currently provides 413 files from five upstream projects:

| Source | License | CDXML | CDX | Main coverage |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| RDKit | BSD-3-Clause | 94 | 126 | parser regressions, queries, templates, patent structures |
| Indigo | Apache-2.0 | 123 | 28 | molecules, reactions, rendering, malformed-input tests |
| cdxml-toolkit | MIT | 34 | 2 | complete linear, wrapped, and branched reaction schemes |
| SAMPL6 | MIT | 1 | 2 | published host/guest structures |
| SAMPL9 | MIT | 2 | 1 | published host/guest structures |

Two files are deliberate malformed-input tests. Four `.cdx` files contain
Base64 transport text rather than raw CDX bytes and are classified separately.
The remaining 407 files are positive round-trip cases. One deliberately broken
coordinate fixture is classified as safe sanitization, and two fixtures that
only discard unused shape styles are classified as lossless normalization.

## Reproduce

```bash
npm run benchmark:cdxml-public:fetch
cargo build -p chemsema-cli
npm run benchmark:cdxml-public
```

To build the ChemDraw-versus-ChemSema visual review gallery for every corpus
entry, run:

```bash
node scripts/render-public-cdxml-visual-review.mjs --all \
  --root tmp/public-corpus-pilot \
  --report tmp/public-cdxml-roundtrip-label-audit/report.json \
  --out tmp/public-cdxml-chemdraw-review-all
```

The gallery normalizes both panels into the ChemDraw reference coordinate
space and searches image scale and translation for maximum ink overlap. Large
references receive a final high-resolution subpixel search so a one-pixel
thumbnail offset cannot masquerade as a bond-contact defect. Review
state, notes, the current item, display mode, opacity, and box-selection mode
are saved to browser local storage as they change. A box drawn on either panel
is stored in reference coordinates, appears on both panels, and immediately
marks the item as an issue. Box-selection mode remains active while navigating
and after reopening the gallery.

The gallery is a diagnostic aid, not the release gate. The automated visual
gate consumes its retained ChemDraw oracles and aligned ChemSema renders:

```bash
npm run benchmark:cdxml-public:visual-gate
# Inspect the current baseline without returning a failing exit status:
npm run benchmark:cdxml-public:visual-gate:report
```

The gate gives every comparable document one vote, regardless of canvas or
file size. Blank canvas pixels never enter the score. Its coarse stage uses
fixed-size local windows and connected missing/extra ink components. A second,
finer stage checks connected-object count, the dimensions of small symbols,
and repeated compact micro-defects such as disconnected dashed-bond endpoint
miters. For complex multi-object drawings, equal component counts plus a close
normalized X/Y position distribution can confirm topology even when one global
pixel scale cannot align every text glyph. All thresholds are expressed in
ChemDraw reference coordinates or normalized structure coordinates, so a
small missing label, sign, or bond detail cannot be diluted by a large molecule,
reaction scheme, or page. The JSON report includes canonical-coordinate boxes
and explicit reason codes for the strongest local defects. Cases without a
real ChemDraw oracle are reported separately and excluded from the pass-rate
denominator. Every gate run also writes
`passed.html` beside the full gallery so accepted cases can be inspected
without mixing in failures. Use `--reuse-report report.json` to rebuild that
page without rerunning pixel analysis.

Set `CHEMSEMA_PUBLIC_CDXML_DIR` to choose another download directory. The
runner writes a detailed untracked report to
`tmp/public-cdxml-roundtrip/report.json`. By default, every positive case is
saved and reopened three times. Each generation is checked with molecule,
arrow-identity, bracket-geometry, atom-label, and free-text semantic
fingerprints as well as object, resource, style, and object-type counts. The
text gates compare source and displayed text, line structure, runs, alignment,
anchor, wrapping, line height, and label/text geometry. Semantic drift and
non-idempotence always fail the run; pass `--strict-counts` to also fail on a
classified count drift.

The current ChemSema 1.0.0-beta.1 source baseline has no unexpected failures,
semantic drift, non-idempotence, or unclassified count drift. Of 413 files, 404
are exact through all three generations, one is expected safe sanitization, two
are expected lossless normalization, two are expected import rejection, and
four transport-encoded files are skipped. The semantic gates cover atomic
identity and charge, molecule connectivity, headless-arrow identity, bracket
grouping and geometry, atom-label realization, and free-text layout; the count
gates independently catch object and resource growth.

The manifest pins every upstream commit and records its license URL. When the
corpus changes, update the manifest, rerun the benchmark, and commit a new
versioned summary rather than silently replacing an old baseline.

The license column records the license published for each upstream repository.
Because the downloader leaves every file in its original repository, this is
appropriate for a reproducible external benchmark. Before repackaging the
files as a standalone dataset, recheck per-file provenance and attribution,
especially for patent-derived RDKit fixtures.

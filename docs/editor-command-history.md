# Editor Command History

This document defines the command layer used by the editor engine. The current
implementation records each committed editing action as a command plus document
snapshots:

```text
HistoryEntry {
  command: EditorCommand,
  before: ChemcoreDocument,
  after: ChemcoreDocument
}
```

The command object is the stable semantic record. The `before` and `after`
documents keep undo/redo behavior exact while the command surface is still
evolving. Later, individual commands can replace full snapshots with smaller
patches or inverse operations without changing the editor event model.

## Rule

Only committed document changes are commands.

Pointer hover, focus halos, preview bonds, lasso outlines, active drag state,
and text cursor movement are interaction state outside history.

## Current Commands

### `add-bond`

Creates a bond from one anchor to another. Either anchor may refer to an
existing node or to a world position that will create/reuse a node.

Recorded data:

- `begin`: anchor node id and world point
- `end`: anchor node id and world point
- `order`: bond order
- `variant`: active bond variant

Typical sources:

- click on blank canvas with the bond tool
- click or drag from an endpoint
- drag from a focus point

### `cycle-bond-style`

Changes the style/order/stereo state of an existing bond center.

Recorded data:

- `bond_id`
- `variant`: active bond variant

Typical sources:

- clicking a bond with single/double/triple/dashed/bold/wedge tools

### `delete-selection`

Deletes the current selection or, when nothing is selected, deletes the current
focused item using command-key semantics.

Selection delete semantics:

- selected bonds are removed
- endpoints of selected bonds are removed only when their original degree is
  fully covered by the selected bonds
- selected atoms are removed together with their incident bonds
- neighboring atoms are kept
- selected labels are converted back to carbon atoms

Typical sources:

- `Delete`
- `Backspace`

### `delete-focused-at-point`

Deletes the focused item at a pointer location.

Recorded data:

- `x`, `y`: world point
- `source`: `delete-tool` or `command-key`

The delete tool and command-key deletion intentionally remain separate because
their endpoint semantics differ.

### `cut-selection`

Copies the current selection into the internal editor clipboard, then deletes
the selection as one undoable command.

Typical source:

- `Ctrl/Cmd+X`

### `paste-clipboard`

Pastes the internal editor clipboard into the editable molecule.

Typical sources:

- paste toolbar button
- `Ctrl/Cmd+V`

### `insert-template`

Commits a structure template.

Recorded data:

- `template`: template id, such as `ring-6` or `benzene`
- `x`, `y`: commit point

Typical sources:

- click or drag with the template tool

### `apply-selection-arrange`

Applies a selection layout command.

Recorded data:

- `command`: toolbar command id

Current command ids:

- `align-left`
- `align-right`
- `align-top`
- `align-bottom`
- `align-h-center`
- `align-v-center`
- `distribute-h`
- `distribute-v`
- `flip-h`
- `flip-v`

### `apply-selection-color`

Applies a color to the current selection.

Recorded data:

- `color`: normalized hex color string

Current behavior:

- selected text objects update their text fill style and rich text run fills
- selected molecule labels update label and run fills
- selected molecule nodes or bonds update the molecule style color
- selected line, bracket, symbol, and shape objects update their stroke and/or fill style color

### `move-selection`

Moves the current selected molecule parts.

The command is opened on the first document-changing drag update and its
`after` snapshot is refreshed until the final mouse-up position.

### `rotate-selection`

Rotates the current selected molecule parts.

The command is opened on the first document-changing rotate update and its
`after` snapshot is refreshed until the final mouse-up angle.

### `apply-text-edit`

Applies an active text edit session.

Recorded target:

- `text-object`: optional object id
- `endpoint-label`: node id

### `replace-hovered-endpoint-label`

Replaces the hovered endpoint with a typed atom or abbreviation label.

Recorded data:

- `label`

### `legacy-mutation`

Fallback command used if a document change still calls the low-level snapshot
API outside a command context. This should be treated as a migration warning:
new editing features should use semantic commands.

## Transient Actions

The following actions are transient UI/runtime actions:

- `copy-selection`: changes only the internal clipboard
- `set-tool`
- `set-template`
- hover/focus updates
- preview generation
- viewport zoom and pan
- open/load document, which resets history

## Implementation Notes

All committed mutations should run inside `Engine::with_command`. Existing
low-level mutation helpers may still call `push_undo_snapshot`; the command
context assigns the current semantic command to that snapshot.

If one user command creates multiple internal snapshots, the command layer
coalesces them into one `HistoryEntry` using the first `before` document and
the final `after` document.

For drag commands, intermediate updates may mutate the document after the first
snapshot. The command layer refreshes the latest matching history entry's
`after` document so redo returns to the final pointer-up state.

# CDX/CDXML 字段复核总账

本总账由官方 CDX 属性/对象表和 Revvity 当前 CDXML DTD 自动生成。机器可读全集见 `schemas/cdx-cdxml-verification-v1.json`。

这里把三件事分开记录：`schemaStatus` 是官方 tag、类型、枚举和默认值是否已核对；`storageStatus` 是是否能无损进入 CCJS、修改并回写；`behaviorStatus` 是是否完成 ChemDraw 实物/视觉行为矩阵。不能用无损保存冒充行为已经完全复现。

当前官方全集：35 个 CDX 对象/辅助对象、262 个 CDX 属性、53 个 CDXML 元素、384 个唯一 CDXML 属性名。无损未覆盖数：0。

## 行为证据门禁

CDXML 不只按 384 个唯一属性名统计，还按“元素 × 属性”展开为 762 个具体声明。当前已复核 762/762，门禁不允许遗留 `in-review`。

这里的 `verified` 不等于“所有对象都已原生重绘”：对于质粒、凝胶标记、化学计量表等专用上下文对象，表示已核对 DTD 词法/枚举/默认值、ChemDraw 对无效上下文的清理行为，以及 CCJS 无损可编辑往返。是原生语义、上下文规则，还是官方明确的只写/未启用，由 `schemas/chemdraw-cdxml-field-evidence-v1.json` 的 `verificationKind` 区分。

原生绘制、编辑和往返的逐项实施顺序见 `docs/cdx-cdxml-native-rendering-backlog.zh-CN.md`。

## 实现规则

- `native-semantic`：已映射为来源无关的 CCJS 明确字段；编辑原生字段，导出器负责换算。
- `typed-interchange`：官方公共词法类型已解析为可编辑 `value`，并保留 tag/type。
- `binary-interchange`：官方没有稳定公共词法形式或结构复杂；保留精确 `rawBase64`，由专用编辑器修改。
- `opaque-by-spec`：官方明确规定为未定义或不解释的字节载荷；不得猜测语义，编辑 `rawBase64`。
- `context-dependent-interchange`：类型由同对象的其他字段决定；保留 `value` 与 `rawBase64`，专用编辑器联合修改。
- `interchange` 不是 `meta`，是 CCJS 顶层的持久化、可编辑、参与导出的正式字段。

## 已知官方表勘误

- `kCDXProp_3DMajorAxisEnd`：发布表 {"cdxmlName":"Center3D"}；采用 {"cdxmlName":"MajorAxisEnd3D"}。依据：SDK constant name, description, and current Revvity DTD。
- `kCDXProp_3DMinorAxisEnd`：发布表 {"cdxmlName":"Center3D"}；采用 {"cdxmlName":"MinorAxisEnd3D"}。依据：SDK constant name, description, and current Revvity DTD。
- `kCDXProp_Closed`：发布表 {"tag":"0x0A38","cdxType":"CDXBoolean"}；采用 {"tag":"0x0A39","cdxType":"CDXBooleanImplied"}。依据：0x0A38 is CurveSpacing; CDX sequence and empty-property encoding。

## ChemDraw 二进制对象 tag 勘误

- ChemDraw 12.0.2 与 21.0.0.28 的实际 CDX 输出一致使用：`Geometry=0x801b`、`Constraint=0x801c`、`TLCPlate=0x801d`、`TLCLane=0x801e`、`TLCSpot=0x801f`、`ChemicalProperty=0x8020`、`Arrow=0x8021`、`Border=0x802a`。发布版静态对象表从 Geometry 起发生了偏移；账本保留其原值为 `publishedTag`，运行时值记为 `tag` 并标为 `verified-with-erratum`。
- 导入器仍识别 ChemSema beta 阶段写出的偏移 tag，但新文件统一写 ChemDraw 实际 tag；这属于格式级兼容，不按单个样例分支。

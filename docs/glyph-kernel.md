# Glyph kernel

ChemSema derives label layout and bond-retreat geometry in the Rust engine from real font outlines stored in [shared/glyph_outlines.json](../shared/glyph_outlines.json). The manifest contains multiple font families and regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic faces where available.

For a label margin `m` and glyph font size `s`, the retreat kernel uses:

```text
q = min(m, 0.25 * s)
natural = real outline dilated by a Euclidean disk of radius m
feature = circles of radius 1.5q at hull vertices moved 0.5q toward the glyph center
axial = contact sectors within 10 degrees of the four cardinal directions
clip = natural union feature union axial
```

Bond bodies, including their finite width, are clipped against `clip`. This is a direct rule, not a character lookup table or a 360-degree fit.

## Data ownership

- `glyphPolygons` contains per-character real-outline hulls for editing, hit testing, and character anchors.
- `glyph_clip_polygons` is derived runtime-only retreat geometry. It is never CCJS authority and is not serialized.
- The former `shared/glyph_clip_polygons.json` character table and its generator have been removed; there is no legacy renderer fallback.
- Missing characters use an explicit font substitution chain, ending at the real `□` glyph outline. The substituted outline supplies both metrics and retreat geometry; there is no synthesized rectangular retreat fallback.

## Rebuild timing

The two geometry layers are rebuilt atomically on document load, text-edit confirmation, and font/style or MarginWidth changes. Typing inside an open text editor does not mutate document geometry. Label dragging translates both layers on every pointer move, so bond retreat stays live before pointer-up.

## Generation and verification

Run `python scripts/generate-glyph-outlines.py`. The `.mjs` entry point delegates to the same generator so there is only one schema implementation. The build script gzip-compresses the manifest before embedding it and the kernel expands it once on first use. Verify with the Rust engine test suite and the viewer WASM build.
